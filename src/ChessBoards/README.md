# ChessBoard Machine Coding Question

This repository contains a solution for the **ChessBoard** problem. The goal of this project is to implement a basic **ChessBoard** layout using React.

## Features

- **Chessboard**: Displays an 8x8 grid representing a chessboard with alternating black and white squares.
- **Square Component**: Each square on the board is a separate component, styled alternately for black and white colors.
